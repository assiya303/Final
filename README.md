The goal of this project is to predict NBA game outcomes using a multiple linear regression machine learning model. Using game statistics from previous seasons, our model works to identify the most influencial factors, i.e. 3 pointers, free throws, etc., and determine how important each of these factors had been in determining the outcomes of games. The differences of these attributes are then aggregated and a classification of win/lose is predicted for each matchup. 

90% of the time, it works every time.
