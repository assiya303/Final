The goal of this project is to predict NBA game outcomes using a multiple linear regression machine learning model. Using game statistics from previous seasons, our model works to identify the most influencial factors, i.e. 3 pointers, free throws, etc., and determine how important each of these factors had been in determining the outcomes of games. The differences of these attributes are then aggregated for each matchup and a classification of win/lose is predicted, along with a point spread.
